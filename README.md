Usage
You can explore the webpage locally to understand how HTML and CSS work together to create a professional-looking website clone. This is a static page with no JavaScript functionality, focusing solely on structure and design.

Components Explained
1. HTML Structure
Header: The header contains the Puma logo, navigation links (Home, Products, Collections, etc.), and a search bar. Each link is implemented using anchor <a> tags, and the layout is achieved through flexbox.
Hero Section: This section features a prominent background image or video banner with a call-to-action. Used a combination of background images, text overlays, and buttons styled with CSS.
Product Grid: Contains several product images organized in a CSS grid layout. Each product is represented by an image, name, and price, all wrapped inside a <div> element.
Footer: The footer includes links to social media, additional info pages (About, Contact, etc.), and other essential links.
2. CSS Styling
Flexbox: Used to align and distribute elements within the header and footer sections. Flexbox allowed for a responsive design that adjusts based on screen size.
Grid Layout: The product grid section uses CSS Grid to arrange products in a responsive layout, maintaining a clean and visually appealing design on different screen sizes.
Media Queries: Used to adjust font sizes, padding, and layout for various screen widths (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
Hover Effects: Hover effects were added to buttons and product images to make the design interactive and closer to the real Puma webpage.
Typography and Colors: CSS variables were used to set the primary colors and font styles, keeping a consistent theme across the page.
3. Responsive Design
Breakpoints: Added CSS breakpoints for tablets and mobile devices, adjusting the layout of each section to enhance usability on smaller screens.
Mobile Navigation: Implemented a collapsible navigation menu for smaller screens, ensuring the header does not overcrowd on mobile devices.
Challenges Faced
Some of the challenges I encountered during this project included:

Replicating a Complex Layout: Structuring the layout of the Puma website clone required careful planning and understanding of HTML and CSS positioning.
Responsive Design Adjustments: Making sure that every element fit perfectly across screen sizes without overlapping or looking cluttered took trial and error.
CSS Flexbox and Grid Mastery: Understanding the intricacies of flexbox and grid was essential to achieve the layout accurately.
Future Improvements
Add JavaScript Functionality: Incorporate JavaScript for added interactivity, such as dropdown menus, sliders, and modal pop-ups.
Optimize CSS for Performance: Minimize and optimize the CSS code for faster load times.
Advanced Animations: Add CSS animations to enhance the visual appeal of certain elements, such as button clicks and image hover effects.
